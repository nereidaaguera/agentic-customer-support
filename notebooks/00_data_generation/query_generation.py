- Customer sees a $25 charge on their April bill they don't recognize - can you explain what it's for?
- The customer's iPhone 15 isn't getting 5G speeds even though they're in a coverage area
- Are there any promotions for upgrading to unlimited data
- How much data did the customer use last month?
- Customer wants to know their voice minutes usage for May 2025
